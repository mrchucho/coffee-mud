== Coffee MUD
Coffee MUD is a simple MUD written in CoffeeScript and using Node.js.

== Running Coffee MUD
For now, Coffee MUD isn't configurable. Makefiles, etc. coming soon.

coffee mud.coffee

Alternatively, you can compile the CoffeeScript and run with node.

== Requirements
I've tested coffee-mud with CoffeeScript 1.1.1 and Node v0.4.7
